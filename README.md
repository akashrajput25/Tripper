# Tripper
This my is my virtual assistant made using python modules. This program requires some modules installation on your system to run: such as <i>speech_recognizer,pip ,pyVoice,Wikipedia</i>. This assistant uses google server for speech to text convertion . You can ask <b>Tripper</b> to do various tasks for you such as :<b> open youtube,google, facebook,instagram, play music,ask the time, open applications(you have to specify the path for that in the source code), search anything on wikipedia or even send email directly by speaking(check the program to enter your email and password for authentication) .</b>
